Hi. Client Hope you are doing so well.
****** THE A SUITABLE GUY FOR YOU ******
Thanks for sharing the well detailed job and I am really eager to bid you that I would be suitable guy for you.
I am just watching the jobs on upwork site and your job is really interesting to me because of my last project. It was scrapping the huge financial stock data from Algo Trading and save those onto xlsx files(using pandas) and make the windows app for real time mornitoring and put the result into serveral csv files on particular directory.
There is buying selling and closing the buying(selling) with specific algorithm.
And now I am currently managing the application with Bloomberg in USA

It's very similar with your and I am fully familiar with all skills that your require.
Hope to discuss further detail about that project.

Thanks
